PDF Summarizer with Amazon Bedrock & Claude 3.7
A generative AI application that summarizes and answers questions about PDF documents using Amazon Bedrock, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Streamlit.

This project demonstrates how to use the Bedrock Converse API to send PDF document bytes directly to the model, eliminating the need for external OCR or text extraction libraries.

🚀 Features
Direct PDF Processing: Sends raw PDF bytes to Claude 3.7.

Interactive UI: Simple interface built with Streamlit.

No Vector DB Required: Uses the model's long context window for immediate document analysis.

📋 Prerequisites
Before running this application, ensure you have the following:

AWS Account: An active AWS account.

Model Access Enabled:

Go to the AWS Bedrock Console.

Navigate to Model access.

Ensure you have requested and been granted access to Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

Python: Python 3.9 or higher installed.

AWS CLI: Configured with credentials that have permission to invoke Bedrock models.

🛠️ Installation
Clone the repository

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Create a virtual environment (Optional but recommended)

Bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies

Bash

pip install boto3 streamlit
⚙️ Configuration
Add your Document: Place the PDF file you want to analyze in the root directory.

Default filename expected by code: amazon-leadership-principles-070621-us.pdf

Note: If you use a different file, update the filename in summarization_lib.py line 4.

AWS Credentials: Ensure your environment uses the correct AWS profile.

Bash

export AWS_PROFILE=default  # Or your specific profile name
🏃‍♂️ Usage
Run the Streamlit application:

Bash

streamlit run summarizatio_app.py
The application will open in your default browser at http://localhost:8501.

Enter your instruction (e.g., "Summarize the top 3 points" or "What does this document say about ownership?").

Click Summarize.

View the response generated by Claude 3.7.

📂 Project Structure
summarizatio_app.py: The frontend user interface using Streamlit.

summarization_lib.py: The backend logic that handles the file reading and Amazon Bedrock API calls.

amazon-leadership-principles...pdf: The sample document (you must provide this).

⚠️ Troubleshooting
Error: AccessDeniedException

Fix: Ensure your IAM user/role has the bedrock:InvokeModel permission and that you have enabled Claude 3.7 Sonnet in the Bedrock Model Access page in the specific region you are using (e.g., us-east-1 or us-west-2).

Error: ResourceNotFoundException

Fix: Check that the modelId in summarization_lib.py matches the ID available in your region. The code currently uses us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0.
